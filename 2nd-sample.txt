Steps for Complete Removal
Hard Reset & Force Push
Use git reset --hard <commit_before_last> to move your branch pointer and local files to the state before the unwanted commit.

Then use git push --force origin <branch> to update the remote so the unwanted commit completely disappears, erasing history.

This also removes the file from your local machine because --hard resets the working directory.

Example Workflow:
bash
# Check your commit log and copy the hash of the commit before your last push
git log --oneline

# Reset everything to this commit
git reset --hard <commit_hash>

# Force the remote repository to match your local state (destroys history after this commit!)
git push --force origin main
Replace <commit_hash> with the hash of the commit you want to go back to, and main with your branch name.

Cautions
Any collaborators will have to sync with the new history. This method deletes history after the reset point from the remote repository.

Ensure that you do not need anything from the commit being deleted.

If more careful history management is needed, git revert <commit_hash> will create a new commit undoing changes but retaining history.

If Only Removing the File
If your intention is to just remove a file (not the whole commit), do:

bash
git rm path/to/file
git commit -m "Remove unwanted file"
git push origin main
This retains commit history and updates both local and remote repo.

Summary Table
Action	Removes Local File	Removes Remote History	Keeps History?
git reset --hard ... + force push	Yes 	Yes 	No 
git revert <commit_hash>	Yes (undoes changes, file stays if deleted) 	No 	Yes 
git rm file + commit + push	Yes 	Yes (file only) 	Yes 
Best Practice Recommendation
For removing both the commit and the file without leaving history, use the hard reset + force push.

For simple file removal without erasing commit history, use git rm, then commit and push.

Always verify the implications before force-pushing to shared repositories.
